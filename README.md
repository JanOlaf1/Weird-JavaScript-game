# RGB Party Game

## Overview

This project is an early exercise in JavaScript, aimed at learning basic functions and improving understanding of game mechanics in a simulated bar environment. The script manages a character's status, including drunkenness, energy, and finances, as they interact with different activities like ordering drinks, eating food, and participating in drinking games. The game also tracks the player's progress through various "party levels," which reflect increasing levels of intoxication and involvement in the nightlife. Each function updates the character's stats, providing feedback through the UI based on their choices. The game is still in development.
